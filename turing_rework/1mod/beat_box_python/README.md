# Intro
In this project we’re going to do some silly things with sound. Specifically, we’re going to make a very basic drum machine program.

However to add some additional depth, let’s also use this project as a chance to explore one of the fundamental data structures in computer science – the Linked List.

## Constraints
- Make sure that your code is well tested for both expected cases and edge cases. Try popping more elements than there are in the list. Try seeing if an empty list includes anything. Try inserting elements at a position beyond the length of the list.
- Avoid using other ruby collections (Arrays, Hashes, etc) for the storage of your beats. That’s where you’re supposed to use the linked list. But having Arrays elsewhere in your code, or using methods that return arrays (like .split) are totally ok.

# Beat Box Runner
The beat box runner allows a user to interact with my code. To run the file, type `ruby beat_box_runner.rb` into your terminal from the beat_box directory.

Please note that the allowed voices function may not work as intended depending on which voices are available on the user's device.
