## Ruby Object Model First Look

First, watch this introductory video from Richard Schneeman:
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4uiyWA8eFk)

Then, watch this video from Peter Cooper describing
the object model in more depth: **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by5fFOBhtPQ)**
(don't worry if many of the concepts from the second video are confusing; we're interested
in the broad picture).

### Questions

After watching the video, answer these 3 questions:

1. Where are instance methods stored for an object?
2. How do we define methods on a class?
3. What is the default receiver of methods invoked within an object?
