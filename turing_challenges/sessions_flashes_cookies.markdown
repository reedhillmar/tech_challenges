# Sessions, Flashes, and Cookies

Implement the following features in your "My Jams" app:

1) A hit counter that tracks the number of times that a particular user has visited the `/songs` route in that particular browsing session. Make this counter in a way that does not allow the user to artificially inflate the value.

2) Validations for presence of song title and artist. When a user does not enter a song title and/or artist, a flash message should appear on the form showing the errors.
